# Release 1.6.19

Upgrading the EMR Core nodes from `c5.xlarge` to `r5.xlarge` to prevent cluster failures due to memory pressure on the Core nodes.

Core nodes will run both Hadoop's file system (HDFS) and Map-Reduce or Spark jobs. Because of this, they require more memory than TASK nodes, which only run Map-Reduce or Spark jobs.

This change will reprovision the EMR cluster. Expect about 15 minutes of downtime, while the new cluster starts up.

# Release 1.6.18

Always granting `ssm:GetParameter` privileges to the `EtleapApp` role, so it can read parameters with the `etleap/` prefix. This fixes an issue introduced in v1.5.6 where the containers will not start if `disable_ssm_access` is set to `true`.
